# wingbeat_frequencies
Code for my 1st article in the PhD, ["Towards in-field insect monitoring based on wingbeat signals: The importance of practice oriented validation strategies"](https://researchportal.be/en/publication/towards-field-insect-monitoring-based-wingbeat-signals-importance-practice-oriented).

In this repository I used `tensorflow.keras` and `scikit-learn` to model wingbeat data as either time series, their frequency representations (PSD) or time-frequency representations (Spectrograms).

It's neither a recently updated or well-organized repository, but someone working on a similar topic could still find interesting classes/functions and jupyter notebooks to get started or perform similar experiments (this is why I'm making it public).
